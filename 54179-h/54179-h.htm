3</span>REMARKS,<br />
<i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Without</span> minutely inquiring into the
origin of the different modes of conveyance at present existing
in this country and others for passengers and goods, I shall
content myself with asking, Why were canals first established?
and What was the great benefit arising from them, which caused so
much as fifteen hundred miles in extent to be executed in less
than a quarter of a century, at a cost of nearly twenty millions
of money, and for the most part during a time of war, when the
highest rate of taxation prevailed?</p>
<p>Previously to the establishment of canals,&mdash;roads,
waggons and horses were the means employed for the conveyance of
goods; and the speed which they accomplished was greater than the
average speed afterwards obtained by canals.&nbsp; But
notwithstanding this advantage, it was found, that to carry a ton
weight of grain, coal, or merchandize one hundred miles cost
upwards of 6<i>l.</i>&nbsp; Hence materials and goods, whose
weight bore a great proportion to their value, could only be
conveyed a few miles <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>from the spot where they were raised or manufactured; and
thus, sources of wealth that have since been highly productive
and profitable were shut up and useless.&nbsp; Baron Dupin in his
excellent work on the Commercial Power of Great Britain,
published 1825, states, &ldquo;Up to 1756 England had not a
single line of artificial navigation; she possessed for
communication by land, only a small number of roads injudiciously
cut and ill kept up.&nbsp; Of a sudden an individual conceives
the idea to profit by the general impulsion which industry had
received, by cutting a canal to carry to Manchester the product
of his mines.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, a town which thrives, and
of which the exuberant wealth seeks everywhere productive
outlets,&mdash;Liverpool,&mdash;aspires to still higher
designs.&nbsp; She is the first to form and realize the project
of opening a navigable channel between the Irish Sea and the
German Ocean.&nbsp; Other channels even more extended are opened
by degrees: thus, within the short space of half a century, a
double row of canals is formed, both for great and small
navigation, for the purpose of uniting together opposite seas;
basins separated by numberless chains of hills and mountains;
opulent ports; industrious towns; fertile plains; and
inexhaustible mines;&mdash;and this presents a development of
more than a thousand leagues in length, upon a portion of
territory not equal to one-fourth of France!&nbsp; The roads
which already existed are enlarged, are reconstructed with more
art, and kept <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>up with more care.&nbsp; New channels are thrown open to
commerce, and a system of roads is now being formed, of which the
total length is at present (1825) more than 46,000 leagues in
England alone.&nbsp; Thanks to these works, at this moment, in
the three kingdoms, 22,300 merchant-vessels, manned by 160,000
men, and capable of carrying two millions of tons of merchandize,
are scarcely sufficient for the exportation of the superfluity of
interior circulation, for the trade along the coast, and for the
importation of those foreign products necessary to keep up a
circulation so immense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As further instances of the effect produced by the same
causes,&mdash;in 1740, before the establishment of canals, the
iron manufactured in England and Scotland employed 59 furnaces,
which produced annually 17,000 tons.&nbsp; In 1827 there were
upwards of 280 furnaces, with an annual produce of 690,000 tons;
during the intervening period canals were cut, connecting the
iron districts with large towns and the ports.&nbsp; In 1750
there was but one smelting furnace in Staffordshire, making less
than 2,000 tons of iron per annum.&nbsp; In 1827 there were 97
furnaces in that district only, making 216,000 tons per
annum.&nbsp; The population of Staffordshire in 1750 was 160,000;
it is now upwards of 350,000.&nbsp; In England in 1750 it was
6,017,000; it is now upwards of 13,000,000.</p>
<p>The total amount of the exports in 1750 was
7,772,039<i>l.</i>; in 1824 it was 56,234,663<i>l.</i>&nbsp; In
1760 <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the
number of ships assessed in Liverpool was 1,245; in 1824, it was
10,001.&nbsp; These statements are sufficient to show the changes
consequent upon the introduction of canals.&nbsp; It was found,
that one horse upon a canal could convey twenty times what he
could upon a road; and that what formerly cost six pounds to send
a hundred miles, could by canals be sent for little more than one
pound.&nbsp; Such is the traffic upon the Birmingham Canal alone,
that at some periods there is a weight of goods and materials
brought by 150 horses and boats, in one day, which by the roads
would require 3,000 horses and 1,000 waggons.&nbsp; We find again
that the population has more than doubled itself in three
principal inland towns, viz. Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds,
since the establishment of canals.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding the advantages that have attended upon the
introduction of canals, there are limits within which their
utility is confined, and, as regards despatch, much
confined.&nbsp; The canals as they are now constructed are
adapted only to horse power, and are subject to the inconvenience
of that slowness of travelling which arises from the great
increased resistance of fluids to bodies moving in them, with
only a very slight increase of velocity.&nbsp; Two horses may
take a loaded boat of twenty-five tons at the rate of four miles
per hour; but to obtain a velocity of twelve miles per hour, it
would require twenty-seven horses.&nbsp; It is found that with a
velocity of six miles per hour so great a surge <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>or swell is
produced in the water as to hazard the sinking of any boats that
are passing.</p>
<p>The stoppages arising at the locks is very considerable.&nbsp;
In the canals between Birmingham and London, every means are used
to effect despatch; but still the quickest passage for the
fly-boats is sixty hours.&nbsp; The distance is 153 miles, and
there are 142 locks; nearly one-third of the time is lost in
passing them; and while this is being done, one horse and four
men are comparatively idle; the expenses of wages and keep
however are going on.&nbsp; These expenses are incurred more
particularly by the haulage; but in addition to them the tonnages
are very high, and of necessity so, since the repairs of so many
locks, cleaning and repairing canal, and above all, the raising
of water to the summit-levels by steam-engines, must incur a
great expense.&nbsp; The cost of this last operation may be
guessed at, when it is known that for every boat that passes from
London to Birmingham, a body of water of 120 tons weight has to
pass through a difference of level of 1,140 feet.&nbsp; And yet
in dry summers, notwithstanding the pains thus bestowed, the
boats are frequently detained, for want of water, twelve,
eighteen, and twenty-four hours in one trip.</p>
<p>Much, then, as the canals surpass the common roads, it appears
that much remains to be done, if their peculiar disadvantages can
be got rid of.</p>
<p>The economy of steam compared with horse power is too well
established to need many comments.&nbsp; <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>The expense of
working a twenty-horse power steam-engine is known to be less
than one-sixth of the cost of twenty horses and men to attend
them.&nbsp; I appeal to the proprietors of the thousands of
steam-engines now in use for the truth of this statement.&nbsp;
Does not, then, a question at once arise, Whether it is not
possible to construct a road of some kind upon which this great
and cheap power may be made to act, instead of horses, and with
as great a degree of profit?&nbsp; We rejoice that the question
has suggested itself, and that it has received an answer.&nbsp;
The application of steam to the purpose of locomotion has been
proved upon a rail-road between Manchester and Liverpool.&nbsp;
Moreover, the economy of steam power when applied to rapid
progression is found to be much greater than when it is employed
to supersede the horse-mill.&nbsp; In this the animal is not
driven beyond his speed, but is allowed to move at a rate of two
miles and a half per hour,&mdash;a speed which he can continue to
perform for eight or ten hours per day.&nbsp; A horse is found to
perform the greatest quantum of work when moving at this rate,
and to be employed most economically.&nbsp; But even compared
with this, we have seen that an equal effect may be produced by
steam power at one-sixth the cost.&nbsp; With how much greater
advantage and profit, then, can steam be applied, where it is
made to supersede the use of horses in rapid motion, of eight or
ten miles per hour! at which work it is known they can continue
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>but one hour
per day, and even then they do not live to half the age of the
horse employed at the slower speed.&nbsp; It is a fact, that
horses employed in the fast coaches and for the fly-boats require
renewing every four years.&nbsp; Can steam power, then, be used
to produce this rapid motion?&nbsp; One hundred thousand persons
that have passed from Liverpool to Manchester in less than two
hours since September last, can answer this question in the
affirmative.</p>
<p>Another great advantage of the railway over the common road is
the much greater safety that it offers.&nbsp; The above number of
passengers have been conveyed with scarcely an accident.&nbsp; Is
there a line of turnpike-road in the kingdom that can make the
same boast, where an equal number of passengers have
travelled?&nbsp; The general causes of accident upon a common
road, such for instance as the horses taking fright, the coachman
losing command over them, the coach running against some obstacle
in the road, or upsetting, cannot happen upon a railway.&nbsp;
The engine can exert no <i>additional</i> force without the
consent of the man who superintends it; one carriage cannot meet
another, as there is a separate line for carriages travelling in
the opposite direction; and even if a wheel breaks, the carriage
is so low that it would not upset.&nbsp; The only objection that
is started on this head, is the bursting of the boiler: this is
now constructed with a number of small tubes, through which the
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>fire
passes, and which are all inclosed in a strong iron case; so that
if one of these small tubes burst, it immediately acts as a
safety-valve, discharging the steam of the boiler into the
chimney, and removing the apprehended danger.</p>
<p>Here then we have safety and despatch, and we may next
consider economy in travelling.&nbsp; In this respect the public
have also found an advantage.&nbsp; The charges by the Liverpool
and Manchester railway are not half what the coaches formerly
charged, the fares being but 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and 5<i>s.</i>
each.&nbsp; And the effect produced is, that the average number
of passengers by the railway is upwards of 1,000 per day.&nbsp;
The average number by the coaches the preceding year was only
about 500 per day, paying 7<i>s.</i> outside and 12<i>s.</i>
inside.&nbsp; Goods are now taken in three hours, and at a charge
of 11<i>s.</i> per ton; they were before thirty-six hours on the
water-conveyance, at a charge of 15<i>s.</i> per ton.</p>
<p>Having then referred to what has been done upon a line of
railway from Liverpool to Manchester, with a profit to the
proprietors and great benefit to the public, let us inquire
whether there is the same want of an improved conveyance from
Birmingham to London.&nbsp; We will first consider the amount
that is now paid, and the time that is now required for conveying
both goods and passengers.&nbsp; The amount paid for the
conveyance of passengers and goods between Birmingham and London
is upwards of 800,000<i>l.</i> per annum; more than half of which
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>is
comparatively at a high rate, as will be seen by the following
statements.</p>
<p>The charges by coaches for passengers are 42<i>s.</i> inside,
and 21<i>s.</i> outside, and for parcels 1<i>d.</i> per
pound.&nbsp; By waggon, the charge is 5<i>s.</i> per cwt.&nbsp;
By fly-boat, for packages and general merchandise, 60<i>s.</i>
per ton; and for iron-castings in boat-loads, 32<i>s.</i>; for
pig-iron, 25<i>s.</i> per ton.&nbsp; Thus the coach charge for
luggage, at ten miles per hour, is 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per ton
per mile; waggon charge, for a rate of three miles and a half per
hour, is 10&frac34;<i>d.</i> per ton per mile; and goods by
fly-boat, at two miles per hour, 6&frac12;<i>d.</i> per ton per
mile; and the lowest rate for pig-iron 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> per ton
per mile.&nbsp; These charges are calculated upon a distance of
110 miles.</p>

<p>for only a portion of the business; as in the above statement
none of the coaching or posting that falls upon the Holyhead
road, at Coventry, Northampton, and many of the towns nearer
London, is taken into the account.&nbsp; The above amount is
calculated from what passes through Birmingham only, and that
exclusive of posting.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>In
addition to the above traffic, there are upwards of 2,000 tons
that pass daily through Birmingham, besides an equal amount upon
the Grand Junction Canal.&nbsp; There is also the whole of the
business that arrives at the different towns upon the line; and
it is ascertained that the passengers by stage-coaches only that
pass through the towns near London, are upwards of four times the
number that pass through Birmingham.&nbsp; But if it appears that
a considerable profit would arise from conveying but a portion of
the business by a railway, it will be much more satisfactory than
if it were dependent upon the whole for an adequate return.&nbsp;
And yet, as it appears that passengers are taken by this mode of
conveyance in half the time in which they can be taken by any
other, and at half the cost, and that goods are conveyed in
one-sixth of the time and at a lower charge, the great
probability is that a considerable portion will immediately be
sent by it.</p>
<p>We will now inquire what would be the cost of conveying by a
railway between Birmingham and London, the passengers and goods
which are now paying by the roads and canals 409,900<i>l.</i> per
annum.</p>
<p>It has been ascertained upon the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, that the whole expenses of one engine, capable of
conveying twenty-five tons of goods 105 miles per day, at a rate
of from ten to fifteen miles per hour, including fuel,
attendance, repairs, oil, grease, &amp;c., is 500<i>l.</i> per
annum.&nbsp; Its <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>eight waggons (the number required for 25 tons) at
30<i>l.</i> per annum each, involve a yearly expense of
240<i>l.</i>&nbsp; This, with the 500<i>l.</i>, makes a total
cost of 740<i>l.</i>&nbsp; We will take it at 800<i>l.</i> per
annum, which gives the following cost, on the supposition that
each engine takes but twenty tons:</p>

repairs of the coaches to be double that of the waggons, or
60<i>l.</i> per annum each; it will make a total amount of
980<i>l.</i>, or say 1000<i>l.</i> per annum, for the four
engines and four sets of coaches</p>

<p>We then have a total cost of only 18,000<i>l.</i>, exclusive
of railway dues, for conveying that by steam power which the
public are now paying 409,900<i>l.</i> for conveying by horses
upon roads and canals in one district only.&nbsp; This, as before
stated, is only a portion of the business.&nbsp; Supposing 2,000
tons of goods to be conveyed daily at 20<i>s.</i> per ton, which
is less <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>than two-thirds of the present average charge; and
taking 300 days per annum, we have 600,000<i>l.</i>; that might
be taken by 200 engines, which with the waggons would cost, at
the rate of 800<i>l.</i> each, 160,000<i>l.</i> per annum.&nbsp;
Nothing is calculated here for the conveyance of cattle, which
may be reckoned upon, when it is known that the present cost of
conveying an ox from Daventry or Leicester to London, including
the loss of weight by driving, is 30<i>s.</i>; and when it is
also known that a weight equal to an ox may be taken that
distance in five hours for 7<i>s.</i>&nbsp; Sheep may also be
taken at a proportionately low rate.&nbsp; Another great source
of income and profit will arise from the conveyance of carriages
and horses, as both will be taken with ease and safety in
vehicles constructed for the purpose.</p>
<p>The question we will next consider is the amount of capital
required for making such a road.&nbsp; The London and Birmingham
Railway is stated at 3,000,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; This is taken from
the most accurate estimates; but for the satisfaction of those
who would like to have corroborative statements, we will compare
it with the cost of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.&nbsp;
This undertaking, it is stated, may cost, including its carrying
department and engines, carriages, &amp;c., 1,000,000<i>l.</i>;
and the railway is thirty-two miles in length.&nbsp; (For
particulars see Appendix, No. I.)</p>
<p>The London and Birmingham Railway will be 105 miles in length;
and therefore, constructed on <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the same scale, and its cost
calculated at the same rate per mile, it would require, including
every expense, rather more than 3,000,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; But it
must be recollected that materials and wages are at least twenty
per cent. lower now than at the time the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway was constructing.&nbsp; The cost of the rails for the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway was 12<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per
ton; they may now be purchased for 8<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per
ton.&nbsp; The considerable reduction that has taken place in the
wages of labour must be taken into account, particularly as
three-fourths of the whole cost will be in an expenditure of this
nature upon the line.&nbsp; The great reduction that has taken
place in all kinds of ironwork will tend to reduce the cost of
the engines, and the machinery required in the construction of
the road.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten, that the Liverpool and Manchester
being the first line of the same magnitude that had ever been
constructed, many expenses occurred, which are always attendant
upon works of a new kind, and which are much reduced when the
same kind of work has to be executed again.&nbsp; It was formerly
the opinion of those who are best acquainted with these subjects,
that railways might be constructed at as little expense as
canals: and when we consider that a canal requires a perfect
level; occupies an equal width of land with a railway; must have
its embankments made of materials impervious to water;&mdash;and
when, again, it is known <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>that an expensive lock is required at
almost every mile, as well as numerous drains and reservoirs to
collect the water from the surrounding country, and powerful
engines to raise the water from the lower to the summit
levels;&mdash;it does appear a natural supposition, that such a
work must require a greater outlay than a road, which, to a
degree, has the inclination suited to the level of the country
over which it passes; whose embankments, instead of being washed
by a river, have only to carry two or four bars of iron; and,
moreover, in whose banks no injury from leakage can arise to the
country lying below it; which invariably happens to land at the
foot of canal embankments.</p>
<p>That funds will be provided for the London and Birmingham
Railway far beyond any amount expended in canals, will be seen by
the following statement:&mdash;In 1825, it is stated, there were
in England ninety-seven canals, the total extent of which was
2,471 miles, and the cost of which was 30,000,000<i>l.</i>;
giving an average cost of about 12,500<i>l.</i> per mile.&nbsp;
The railway from London to Birmingham will be 105 miles in
length, and capital to the amount of 3,000,000<i>l.</i> will be
provided for it: this gives an average of upwards of
28,000<i>l.</i> per mile.&nbsp; That the land in this direction
is more favourable to works of this kind than that in many other
parts of the country, is known by the canals that run in this
district costing less per mile than the average rate of
others.&nbsp; But even if the Railway costs twice or <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>three times
as much as a canal, the advantages that it has over a canal in
its amount of traffic, and the economy attending it, are in a
much greater proportion than the increase of its cost.</p>
<p>There are very few canals of any extent that can pass more
than two hundred tons of goods per hour.&nbsp; The locks in
general admit of but one boat passing at a time, carrying from
twenty to twenty-five tons.&nbsp; Where the greatest despatch is
used, the average is not more than eight boats passed per
hour.&nbsp; Here at once is a limit to the despatch of canal
conveyance.&nbsp; Eight boats per hour, at an average load of
twenty tons, gives only 160 tons per hour as the greatest
quantity that can be passed.&nbsp; The average load of a fly-boat
is but sixteen tons.</p>
<p>Let us now inquire what might be conveyed along a single line
of railway, on the supposition that a speed of ten miles per hour
only may be performed upon it.&nbsp; The number of yards in a
mile (1,760) multiplied by the speed, gives 17,600.&nbsp; A
carriage for three tons of goods occupies a space of four yards
and a half; but we will suppose a space of six yards is required,
which gives two yards for each ton.&nbsp; Then 17,600 (the number
of yards per mile multiplied by the velocity) divided by 2 yards,
gives 8,800 tons per hour, on the supposition that the carriages
moved in a continuous train; but with a space between each train
of carriages equal in length to the train, we have half that
amount, or 4,400 tons, that might if necessary be conveyed <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>upon a single
line of railway: or, what requires twenty-four hours to pass
through the canal locks at Birmingham, might be sent along a
railway in one hour.&nbsp; Thus it appears, that canals are
limited, in respect of the quantity of goods that can be conveyed
upon them, to less than 200 tons per hour; their greatest average
speed is less than three miles per hour, and for the slow boats
one mile and a half per hour; the general expense of haulage is
1<i>d.</i> per ton per mile; they are subject to stoppages
averaging five weeks per annum, from frost, drought, and
repairs.&nbsp; A railway, on the contrary, may convey 4,000 tons
per hour, at a velocity of fifteen miles: steam propelling power
costs only one farthing per ton per mile, exclusive of the
waggons; and the stoppage that would arise from the breaking of a
rail, would not be more than one of half an hour.</p>
<p>Does not this show, then, that an infinitely superior
conveyance is now offered to the public, both for themselves and
their goods?&nbsp; An instance of the support which the public
give to quick conveyance, is afforded by the facts, that in 1800
there were seven coaches from Birmingham to London, and the
average time was eighteen and twenty hours; that at present there
are twenty-two coaches, and the average time is twelve hours.</p>
<p>Last year the number of passengers from Liverpool to
Manchester was 500 per day, and the time occupied by the journey
four hours.&nbsp; Since the <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>opening of the Railway in September
last, the average number has been nearly 1,000 per day, and the
time two hours.&nbsp; The increase of passing between the towns
that have had steam communication has been in a much greater
proportion than the above.&nbsp; Between London and Margate,
Dover and Calais, Liverpool and Dublin, Liverpool and Greenock,
Stockton and Darlington, the passing has increased nearly
ten-fold since the establishment of such improved
conveyance.&nbsp; It is calculated that the whole number of
passengers by steam-boats is one million and a quarter per
annum.&nbsp; Can it then be expected that a steam communication
from Birmingham to London will be an exception? for there is not
a line to be found of equal extent in the kingdom on which the
population is so great, or on which the commercial and
agricultural transactions are so important.&nbsp; As the utility
of railroads may be considered established by the one now in
operation, it must be evident how desirable it is to connect
Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham, and ultimately other towns
in the North, with the Metropolis.&nbsp; Supposing a railroad
connecting these important towns to exist, which might be
considered as the chief line of communication from the North to
the South, there is a reasonable hope, that shortly other roads
would be proposed and executed, connecting the remaining
influential towns.&nbsp; An expeditious, cheap, and secure
conveyance would thus be established throughout the country; so
that in all probability, the business <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>that would be brought upon the main
line by these side channels would increase the whole traffic
beyond what can now be calculated upon.</p>
<p>It may be objected, that railroads would throw out of
employment a great number of people, who are now actively
engaged, as coachmen, guards, horse-keepers, boatmen, waggoners,
&amp;c.: but as all improvements which tend to reduce the price
of travelling and quick communication have led to a different
result, we may infer that the number of cross coaches and short
conveyances of all kinds that would be established to bring up
passengers and goods to the railway, would at once give
employment to these men.&nbsp; We may take as a proof the present
posting and travelling upon the road from London to Dover, which
was greater in 1829 than ever it was known to be before, although
in the same year upwards of 1,000 passengers were conveyed weekly
from London to Calais by steam.&nbsp; If indeed there are some
persons that will be thrown out of employment for a short time,
we must set against this the vast increase of labour that will be
given to mechanics and others employed in manufacturing the
engines and machines used on railways; for if these works go
forward, there will be immediate employment for tens of thousands
of labourers, and constant occupation in the workshop for double
the number of hands that for a time may be thrown out of work
upon the roads or canals.&nbsp; And I would ask, Which is the
more important member <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>of the community, the ingenious
mechanic or the wandering boatman?</p>
<p>Let us again consider, that we are generating a new power,
with the consumption only of a mineral drawn from the bowels of
the earth, while we are saving the surface land to produce that
sustenance which our increasing population requires.&nbsp; Every
horse that is dispensed with, saves the produce that would
support six men; and it is calculated that one-third of the grain
consumed, is by horses <a name="citation21"></a><a
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a>.&nbsp; The immense
surface that is now required for the support of cattle may be
conjectured, when it is known that in England and Wales alone we
have upwards of thirty millions of acres in tillage, and that one
acre may grow as much corn as is consumed by three men in a
year.&nbsp; And yet we are in the habit of importing a
considerable quantity of grain!</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to establish by reasoning what is borne out
by facts; and I refer again to the railroad between Liverpool and
Manchester, on which goods and merchandise are now taken in
one-tenth of the time and at two-thirds of the former cost, and
passengers in half the time and at <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>half the former charges by
coach.&nbsp; May not the same support be looked for between
London, and Birmingham, when the same advantages are
offered?&nbsp; May not also the support of Government be
expected, when its sanction only is asked to establish such a
communication from one side of the kingdom to the other, not a
farthing to defray expenses being required from it; at the same
time that the capability is offered it, of sending despatches
from London to Liverpool in seven hours, or of transporting
twenty thousand troops the same distance within twelve hours, in
case of need?</p>
<p>Though the capital required is considerable, yet I think the
public may be trusted in seeking out their own means of
investment; they are in fact only carrying <i>that</i> principle
to the establishment of an improved conveyance at the cost of an
old one, (an improvement in which many of them are deeply
interested,) upon which in their manufactories they constantly
act, when a machine that costs 100<i>l.</i> is supplanted by one
that may cost 500<i>l.</i>, but which is found to perform ten
times the work.&nbsp; Why, I ask, may not 3,000 individuals
associate themselves together to apply to a public undertaking
the mechanical power which they have found so advantageous in
their private establishments?&nbsp; Why not extend to the purpose
of locomotion the power which has raised the manufactures of
Great Britain and Ireland to their present high state of
improvement?&nbsp; I would ask those who oppose its extension <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>to this new
purpose, whether the mechanical agencies of this kingdom, now
amounting to the physical force of ten times the population of
England, would ever have been called into action if the
application of known powers and principles to fresh purposes and
uses had not at all times met with the fullest support of the
Legislature and the Public?</p>
<p>I would ask again, Whether the steam power that has been
generated within the last fifteen years, for propelling vessels
exceeding the whole physical force of the British navy, would
have had birth, had the principle been acted upon, of things
remaining as they are?</p>

<h3>No.&nbsp; II.</h3>
<p><i>The Speech of the Rev. </i><span class="smcap"><i>John
Corrie</i></span>, <i>F.R.S.</i>, <i>taken from the Report of the
Town&rsquo;s Meeting</i>, <i>held in Birmingham</i>, <i>March</i>
4<i>th</i>, 1831, <i>in support of Railways</i>.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. Corrie said, that having been desired to introduce
the business of the Meeting, he had undertaken the task, from a
conviction that it would be no difficult thing to show the
superiority of railways to all the established modes of
communication, and the benefits which the town of Birmingham in
particular would derive from that great national line, which this
Meeting had assembled to support.&nbsp; It was quite unnecessary
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>to dwell
upon the importance of safe, easy, and especially cheap means of
intercourse.&nbsp; The whole history of human civilization
attested it.&nbsp; Why did population first spread along the
banks of great rivers?&nbsp; Why were the banks of the Euphrates
and the Nile the seats of the earliest civilization? the cradles
of science and the arts of life?&nbsp; Principally, if not
entirely, from the facilities they afforded of cheap and easy
communication.&nbsp; What raised Ph&oelig;nicia to such high
celebrity among ancient nations?&nbsp; Not a narrow strip of
rocky territory, but its position on the sea shore; not its
abundant harvests, but its memorable ports, its Tyre and
Sidon.&nbsp; The name and language of the Greeks were most widely
diffused; their numbers, their civilization, their progress in
the sciences, in the elegant and useful arts, were most marked,
when in the days of the Ptolemies they possessed the first
mercantile city of the world&mdash;Alexandria,&mdash;and had
colonies on every little island and rocky promontory in the whole
circuit of the Mediterranean.&nbsp; Or if we descend to modern
times, What raised Italy to its early commercial eminence but the
length of its indented coast?&nbsp; What raised great cities on
the banks of the Elbe, or the Rhine, and carried manufactures
into the heart of Germany, but those great rivers?&nbsp; What
raised Flanders,&mdash;especially what raised Holland, but its
canals and sea-ports?&nbsp; What in more recent times has
occasioned the rapid extension of people, wealth, and property
through the wide circuit of the United States, but the extent of
its navigable rivers; those rivers on which the transcendent
utility of steam navigation was fully established?&nbsp; Or to
come nearer home, What would England be without her extent of
coast, without her facility of carriage?&nbsp; There are many
still in the vigour of their faculties who have witnessed the
progress of this country during the memorable reign of George
III.&mdash;a period of rapid progress in numbers, in wealth, in
power, and in all the arts, with which no other period will bear
one moment&rsquo;s comparison.&nbsp; How much of this was owing
to our turnpike-roads&mdash;to our canals?&nbsp; What would
Birmingham, in particular, be without them?&nbsp; What would be
the value of the mines of Staffordshire, in the very centre of
the island, and without a navigable river?&nbsp; But the art and
industry of man has surmounted every difficulty.&nbsp; Birmingham
is not only connected with all the kingdom by a system of
excellent roads, but has a water-communication with London, with
Liverpool, with Bristol, with Hull; and it is from the opening of
these canals that you must date its great prosperity.&nbsp; In
1760, Birmingham had less than 30,000 inhabitants: by the last
census it had 106,000; it has now probably 130,000.&nbsp;
Connected with the ocean, it is connected with the world; its
name is known wherever the name of England is known; its useful
and ingenious productions are spread over the civilized and the
uncivilized regions of the globe.&nbsp; But how is it that
roads,&mdash;how is it that canals, have produced such wonderful
effects?&nbsp; Solely by affording the means of easy, of safe, of
regular, of rapid, of economical <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>communication.&nbsp; Which of your
productions could have been sent over Europe, which to America,
to India, to China, loaded with the weight of land-carriage from
hence to the nearest of our ports?&nbsp; At least how few could
have been either sent or sold!&nbsp; But how superior in all the
particulars I have mentioned are railways to canals or turnpike
roads!&nbsp; The ease, the smoothness, is that of one smooth bar
of iron revolving on another; the motion of the best built
carriage, on the best constructed road, is comparatively rough
and jarring.&nbsp; You move with no more fatigue than from
sitting in your chamber.&nbsp; Then for regularity,&mdash;here
are no interruptions from drought, none from frost, none from
snow, none from tedious periodical repairs.&nbsp; In
safety,&mdash;inquire, and you find in the last six months
upwards of 100,000 persons have passed between Liverpool and
Manchester without an accident.&nbsp; Can you say the same of any
equal length of turnpike-road?&nbsp; As for rapidity, this is
truly astonishing,&mdash;this sets all competition at defiance;
this almost realises the extravagant demand of the poet, that the
gods would annihilate both space and time.&nbsp; It will condense
the whole population of the kingdom, as to all purposes of
intercourse for business or amusement; while it spreads it over
the whole surface for purposes of healthful air and beautiful
country scenery; and we know not yet its maximum rapidity; but
our gardens, our farms, above all, our mines and manufactories,
will be placed as near the great sea-ports and the sea as if
Birmingham was only 30 or 40 miles from Liverpool or
London.&nbsp; But the great point of all is the economy: and
here, while we claim the right to assert a great economy, we may
readily allow that there may not have been sufficient time to
estimate all the expenses with which railways and engines of
rapid motion may be attended.&nbsp; But would the low prices have
been fixed between Liverpool and Manchester if the managers of
this interesting establishment had not found they could with
justice to the proprietors take those reduced prices?&nbsp; The
repair of engines appears great: average this on the quantity of
work performed, and you find the charge per passenger or per ton
is a mere trifle,&mdash;a fraction of a farthing.&nbsp; We will
however admit that more time is necessary to ascertain the exact
expense.&nbsp; But we must not forget that no great improvement
is ever perfected at once: whatever be the expense at first, may
we not justly expect it will be reduced?&mdash;A curious paper
has been published on the power, or what is called the duty, of
the steam-engine in Cornwall.&nbsp; You know that instrument is
there used most extensively to drain the deep and valuable
mines.&nbsp; At the earliest record in the document to which I am
referring, the quantity of water raised by a bushel of coals is
denoted by the number 5.&nbsp; The attention of the greatest
engineers was drawn to this county.&nbsp; The celebrated Smeaton
made considerable improvements; the memorable discovery which
placed our late illustrious neighbour Mr. Watt in the very first
rank of benefactors to his country and mankind, raised the
efficiency <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>of a single bushel to 25; subsequently, I believe, still
higher.&nbsp; But since his time, merely by a patient attention
to every minute circumstance in the construction and the working
of the engine, without any new discovery, the duty has been
raised from 25 to 85 or 95.&nbsp; Here is a progress, during no
very long period: and even were the expense of the locomotive
engine ten or twenty times greater than it is, there would be no
reason to despair of its economy.&nbsp; Am I not justified then
in contending that this town is most deeply interested in the
establishment of a railway to Liverpool and to London?&nbsp; It
never was more deeply interested in any contrivance to diminish
the expense of carriage than at this moment.&nbsp; What is the
state of the iron trade of Staffordshire?&nbsp; What the prospect
of that industrious population which depends upon it?&nbsp; A
reduction of one half in the expense of carriage, which the
railways appear justly to promise, would convert a bad trade into
a good one; would give Staffordshire a superiority over all
competitors.&nbsp; At this moment the remission of the duty on
sea-borne coals will narrow the market of the Staffordshire coal
trade.&nbsp; The railway may not only restore the balance, but
incline it in favour of Staffordshire, whose mines lie nearest of
any to the metropolis.&nbsp; But the superiority of railways is a
question of fact; it must be decided by actual experiment; and it
has been decided by experiment between Manchester and
Liverpool.</p>
<p>But it is said, the railway may be a good thing for the
country; but what will it be for those who consume their capitals
in forming it; what does it promise to its proprietors?&nbsp; In
the first place, I would observe that the common
expression,&mdash;it may be good for the country and bad for the
proprietors,&mdash;expresses what never can be true: it never can
be for the good of the country that any capital should be so
invested as not to make an adequate return.&nbsp; This is a
matter of calculation.&nbsp; Numberless railways have been
constructed, (though the application of the locomotive engine is
a comparatively recent improvement); and it must be possible to
form some judgment of the capital required.&nbsp; It is true that
in all great works this is difficult, and we are often reminded
of the original estimate and ultimate expense of the Liverpool
and Manchester railway.&nbsp; But are railways the only works in
which estimates have been erroneous?&nbsp; Has it never happened
in buildings, in roads, in bridges, in canals?&nbsp; And is it
impossible for any care, and any caution, to avoid gross
mistakes?&nbsp; Be assured that no care will be spared on this
subject by those who are inviting the public to invest a capital
of three millions; their calculations are founded, not on the
estimate, but on the actual expenditure of the Liverpool and
Manchester railway: they suppose theirs <i>will cost</i> as much
as the other actually <i>has cost</i>.&nbsp; Is that an
objectionable basis to build upon?&nbsp; They pledge themselves
to ascertain the probable expense, and will not rest on the
judgment of any one man, however superior they may justly and
confidently think him.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>But a
suspicion is whispered abroad, that the public are ill informed
respecting the actual expenses, the profits, and the prospects of
that railway, on which we ground all our plans and expectations;
the statements circulated are said not to be open, candid, and
above-board.&nbsp; Sir, I should be ashamed to enter on a
justification of men so well known to the world, of such high
honour, such unsullied integrity as those gentlemen, who are best
known among the projectors and supporters of the Liverpool and
Manchester railway.&nbsp; But if any one should still cherish his
suspicions,&mdash;what has been their conduct?&nbsp; If they have
deceived the public, why did they continue to hold their shares
after they had reached 100<i>l.</i> per cent. premium?&nbsp; When
they began to decline,&mdash;and they have declined,&mdash;why
did they still hold them?&nbsp; Why are they among the first to
encourage similar undertakings in favourable situations?&nbsp;
Why were they among the earliest, why are they among the greatest
shareholders in those railways, which are the object of our
present meeting?&nbsp; But they are enthusiasts; they are blinded
by their pre-conceived opinions, or by some feeling of
honour.&nbsp; But are there not men at Liverpool, not connected
with them, and able to expose their misstatements, to unmask
their artifices?&nbsp; Many;&mdash;and how are these disclosing
their sentiments respecting railways?&nbsp; <i>By embarking in a
new railway</i>, <i>carried very nearly through the same line of
country with that now at work</i>; for such is that projected
between Liverpool and Leeds.</p>
<p>With regard to the traffic on the lines connected with
Birmingham, I am not prepared on this occasion to go into detail;
other persons well informed on this subject will address
you.&nbsp; But look for a moment at the canals between Liverpool
and London, the Duke of Bridgewater&rsquo;s, the Trent and
Mersey, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire, the great
Birmingham canal, the Warwick, the Napton, the Coventry, the
Oxford, the Grand Junction,&mdash;all of which have paid the
proprietors amply, some enormously.&nbsp; They sufficiently
indicate the extent of traffic.&nbsp; Add to this the
land-conveyance by coaches, chaises, private carriages, waggons,
vans, amounting at least to 300,000<i>l.</i> per annum, between
Birmingham and London;&mdash;add the cattle sent from
Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, &amp;c. to the London markets,
and which the railways will convey for less than the value of the
flesh lost in driving;&mdash;add those kinds of agricultural
produce which require a smooth and rapid transport.&nbsp; In
short, statements have been made out by persons of no mean
capacity, which show a profit so ample as to render the reader
incredulous from its magnitude.&nbsp; There probably may be
error, but after rigid correction the return must be ample.</p>
<p>Railways will no doubt be extended; and if they are what they
profess to be, the sooner the better: they will be extended
wherever the traffic and intercourse are great; and if we were to
attempt to estimate the sum now paid for carriage on all those
great lines,&mdash;I know not what it is, <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>what it is
supposed to be;&mdash;but be it a million, be it a million and a
half, or two millions, if we are rejoiced at the remission of a
tax of four or five hundred thousand per annum,&mdash;will the
country derive no benefit from being relieved from a tax of half
a million or a million on the expenses of conveyance?</p>
<p>The railways, which we are now considering, resting with one
extremity on the metropolis, extending thence by way of
Birmingham, through Staffordshire to Liverpool, and by Liverpool
connected with all the north of Ireland and west of Scotland, to
the north of Birmingham sending off a branch through Manchester
to Leeds and the West Riding of Yorkshire,&mdash;will connect all
the greatest towns, all the greatest manufacturing districts with
each other and with the metropolis; and on the other hand, will
thus connect the metropolis with them; they will serve as the
means of intercourse among a population, which was of <span
class="GutSmall">FOUR MILLIONS</span>, when the whole kingdom
contained less than <span class="GutSmall">TWELVE</span>, and
this without any wide deviation from the most direct
course.&nbsp; The distance by Birmingham is not more than three
miles more than the distance in a straight line from London to
Liverpool, not more than nine miles more than the direct distance
between Manchester and London.</p>
<p>[He had much more to say, but had already trespassed so long
upon their patience, that he would leave other topics to the many
other well-informed gentlemen who were prepared to address
them.]</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
